# ChatDKU Advising FAQ Evaluation with RAGAS  

This project evaluates the accuracy and relevance of responses generated by **ChatDKU Advising** using **RAGAS**. The evaluation is conducted by comparing ChatDKU Advising's answers to the official FAQ responses provided by the **Academic Advising Office at Duke Kunshan University (DKU)**.  

## About ChatDKU  
**ChatDKU** is a **RAG-based AI chatbot** designed to enhance campus interaction by providing academic advising and administrative support. The system integrates multi-source retrieval, query optimization, and context-aware prompt engineering to deliver high-quality responses.  

> ⚠️ **Due to its potential future role as an official DKU resource, the complete project code remains private.** However, this evaluation project provides insight into its effectiveness.
